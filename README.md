# UE4-SteamSDK

A plugin to implement the Steam SDK for Unreal Engine 4 and make it available to Blueprints

At the moment the Unreal Engine has very limited Blueprintable implementation of the Steam SDK, most likely to discourage use of a competitor. While they have announced the development of their own similar SDK, this will most likely be limited to use with games being published on the Epic Games Store. To solve this issue, I started developing this plugin which will expose the SDK to blueprints.

At the moment, this plugin inexplicately causes the Unreal Editor to refuse to open. As it seems to be compiling just fine, I've given up on this project for now, as I cannot see how to proceed. If you would like to contribute, please feel free to create a fork, and I will review any pull requests.
